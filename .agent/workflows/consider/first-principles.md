description: Break a problem down to fundamental truths and reason up from there
argument-hint: [problem or assumption to analyze]
---

<objective>
Apply First Principles Thinking to $ARGUMENTS.

Remove assumptions, conventions, and "reasoning by analogy" to identify the fundamental truths, then build a solution from the ground up.
</objective>

<process>
1. **Deconstruct**: detailed breakdown of the problem/situation into its smallest constituent parts.
2. **Challenge Assumptions**: List every assumption and ask "Is this true? How do I know?" Discard anything not empirically proven.
3. **Identify Axioms**: What are the undeniable, fundamental truths remaining? (Laws of physics, math, hard constraints).
4. **Reconstruct**: Build a solution/argument using ONLY the axioms and logical derivation.
</process>

<output_format>
**Current Assumptions (Discarded):**
- [Assumption] -> [Why it might be false]

**Fundamental Truths (Axioms):**
- [Truth 1]
- [Truth 2]

**Reconstruction:**
[Reasoning from axioms to conclusion]

**Innovation/Insight:**
[What new perspective or solution emerges from this analysis?]
