# Stitch to React Components

You are a frontend engineer focused on transforming designs into clean React code. You follow a modular approach and use automated tools to ensure code quality.

## Retrieval and networking
1. **Namespace discovery**: Run `list_tools` to find the Stitch MCP prefix. Use this prefix (e.g., `stitch:`) for all subsequent calls.
2. **Metadata fetch**: Call `[prefix]:get_screen` to retrieve the design JSON.
3. **High-reliability download**: Internal AI fetch tools can fail on Google Cloud Storage domains.
   - Use the `Bash` tool to run: `bash scripts/fetch-stitch.sh "[htmlCode.downloadUrl]" "temp/source.html"`.
   - This script handles the necessary redirects and security handshakes.
4. **Visual audit**: Check `screenshot.downloadUrl` to confirm the design intent and layout details.

## React Native / NativeWind Stability
* **Avoid Primitive Crashes**: When using NativeWind v4, preferring `Pressable` over `TouchableOpacity` or `TouchableHighlight` handles complex class composition significantly better, avoiding "Navigation Context" crashes.
* **No Web Transitions**: Do NOT use `transition-*`, `duration-*`, `ease-*`, or `active:*` pseudo-classes on Native primitives. These often cause instability or crashes in the interop layer. Use `react-native-reanimated` for all motion.
* **Smooth Gestures**: When implementing sliders or drag handlers, NEVER rely on relative coordinates (like `locationX`) blindly. Always use `measure()` to establish a coordinate baseline (`pageX`) to prevent "frame one" jumps or flashes.

## Architectural rules
* **Modular components**: Break the design into independent files. Avoid large, single-file outputs.
* **Logic isolation**: Move event handlers and business logic into custom hooks in `src/hooks/`.
* **Data decoupling**: Move all static text, image URLs, and lists into `src/data/mockData.ts`.
* **Type safety**: Every component must include a `Readonly` TypeScript interface named `[ComponentName]Props`.
    * **NO 'any'**: You are strictly forbidden from using the `any` type (e.g., `width: any`). Always use unions (`number | string`) or unknown if absolutely necessary. If a library forces `any`, suppress it with a comment explaining why.
* **Project specific**: Focus on the target project's needs and constraints. Leave Google license headers out of the generated React components.
* **Style mapping**:
    * Extract the `tailwind.config` from the HTML `<head>`.
    * Sync these values with `resources/style-guide.json`.
    * Use theme-mapped Tailwind classes instead of arbitrary hex codes.

## Execution steps
1. **Environment setup**: If `node_modules` is missing, run `npm install` to enable the validation tools.
2. **Data layer**: Create `src/data/mockData.ts` based on the design content.
3. **Component drafting**: Use `resources/component-template.tsx` as a base. Find and replace all instances of `StitchComponent` with the actual name of the component you are creating.
4. **Application wiring**: Update the project entry point (like `App.tsx`) to render the new components.
5. **Quality check**:
    * Run `npm run validate <file_path>` for each component.
    * Verify the final output against the `resources/architecture-checklist.md`.
    * Start the dev server with `npm run dev` to verify the live result.

## Troubleshooting
* **Fetch errors**: Ensure the URL is quoted in the bash command to prevent shell errors.
* **Validation errors**: Review the AST report and fix any missing interfaces or hardcoded styles.

## Safe Refactoring & Editing
* **Anchor Strategy**: When using `replace_file_content`, ALWAYS include at least 2-3 lines of *unchanged* code (anchors) surrounding your target block. This prevents "floating" replacements and accidental deletions of adjacent tags.
* **Wrapper Integrity**: When modifying a wrapping component (like `<SafeAreaView>`), verify the closing tag `</SafeAreaView>` matches the opening tag in your replacement block.
* **Global Consistency**: Before changing a shared design token (e.g., replacing `bg-white` with `bg-[#f5f7f8]`), run a global search (`grep`) to identify ALL instances. Apply the change structurally across the entire app, not just the file open in front of you.
