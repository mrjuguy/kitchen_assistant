# Supabase Best Practices

## Edge Functions & TypeScript (CRITICAL)
- **Runtime Conflict**: Edge Functions run on Deno, which uses URL imports (e.g., `import ... from "https://..."`). The main React Native project runs on Node/Metro and will fail to compile these imports.
- **The Rule**: Whenever you create or modify a file in `supabase/functions/`, you **MUST** ensure that `supabase/functions` is added to the `exclude` array in the root `tsconfig.json`.
  - **Check**: Run `cat tsconfig.json` immediately after creating an Edge Function.
  - **Fix**:
    ```json
    "exclude": ["node_modules", "supabase/functions"]
    ```

## Client Setup
- Initialize the client in `src/lib/supabase.ts`.
- Use environment variables for `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

## Real-time Updates
- Enable Real-time on specific tables in the Supabase dashboard.
- Subscribe to changes using `supabase.channel('channel_name').on(...).subscribe()`.

## Data Fetching
- Use **PostgREST** filters (e.g., `.eq()`, `.select()`).
- Combine with `React Query` for caching and state management.

## Auth
- Use `supabase.auth.getSession()` and `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange()` to manage user sessions.
- In Expo, use a secure storage solution like `expo-secure-store` to persist the session.

## Row Level Security (RLS)
- Always enable RLS in production.
- **Idempotency**: PostgreSQL `CREATE POLICY` fails if a policy name exists. Use `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "name" ON table;` before `CREATE` to ensure scripts are repeatable.
- **Broad Permissions**: For shared data (like households), ensure policies cover `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` specifically. Use `FOR ALL` carefully.
- Define policies to ensure users can only access data belonging to their `household_id`.

## PostgREST & Schema Cache
- **Join Errors (PGRST200)**: If you receive "Could not find a relationship between tables", Supabase's cache is stale. 
  - **Fix 1**: Use sequential fetching (two separate `.from()` calls) instead of a join.
  - **Fix 2**: Run `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';` in the Supabase SQL editor.
- **Missing Columns (PGRST204)**: Ensure new columns exist in the DB before querying. If they do, use Fix 2 above.

## Schema & Constraint Integrity
- **Schema Sync**: Always verify that new columns are physically added to the dashboard before deploying code that tries to insert into them.
- **Migration Output (Mandatory)**: If you modify any interface in `types/schema.ts` to add or change a field, you **MUST** immediately generate and present the corresponding SQL command (`ALTER TABLE...`) to the user. Do not assume the DB matches the Types.
- **Strict Interface Matching**: NEVER add a field to a TypeScript interface (e.g., `RecipeIngredient`) that maps to a database table without first verifying that the column exists in Supabase. If missing, propose/perform the `ALTER TABLE` immediately.
- **Foreign Keys**: When using shared IDs (like `household_id`), ensure the parent record exists, or Foreign Key constraints will block child inserts.
- **Auth Triggers & Profiles**: AUTOMATION IS MANDATORY.
  - **Issue**: Relying on the client to create a user profile after signup is flaky and leads to race conditions.
  - **Rule**: You MUST create a PostgreSQL Trigger (`ON INSERT TO auth.users`) that automatically inserts a row into `public.profiles`.
  - **Code**:
    ```sql
    create trigger on_auth_user_created after insert on auth.users for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();
    ```

## Invite Flows & Public Access (The RLS Trap)
- **The Problem**: RLS policies typically say "Users can only see data they belong to." But to **join** a group (Household/Team), a user needs to "see" it first to verify the code. RLS will return an empty result because they aren't a member yet.
- **The Fix**: Do NOT weaken table RLS. Instead, use a **Security Definer RPC**.
- **Rule**: Create a Postgres Function (`SECURITY DEFINER`) that takes the Invite Code as an argument, bypasses RLS to verify valid code, and performs the membership insertion. The Client should acting *only* via this RPC for joining.
