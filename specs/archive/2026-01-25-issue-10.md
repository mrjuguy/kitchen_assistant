# Issue 10: Refactor Inline Styles to Tailwind

**Original Linear ID**: VC-14
**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: ✅ Completed (2026-01-25)

**Original Scope**: Many components (PantryCard, index.tsx) use inline style objects style={{...}} mixed with Tailwind. Refactor these to use NativeWind/Tailwind classes entirely for consistency and dark mode support.

## Completion Summary

Successfully migrated entire application from inline styles to NativeWind v4 (Tailwind CSS) utility classes.

### Achievements
- **30+ Components Refactored**: All UI components across 6 main tabs (Login, Inventory, Recipes, Shopping, Planner, Profile)
- **Code Reduction**: Removed 700+ lines of inline style code
- **Design Standardization**: Unified on premium off-white palette (#f5f7f8 backgrounds, #ffffff surfaces)
- **Type Safety Improvements**: Enhanced Skeleton loading system with strict TypeScript interfaces
- **Error Handling Refinement**: Improved Planner alert visual feedback and consistency
- **Test Coverage**: All 54 tests passing post-migration

### Technical Details
- **Migration Scope**: Login screen, PantryCard, RecipeCard, ShoppingItemCard, MealCard, ExpiryBadge, ProductDetailModal, AddItemForm, QuantityControl, WastingSoonCard, and all supporting components
- **Architecture**: Zero inline `style={{...}}` objects, 100% utility-class based
- **Android Compatibility**: Maintained native `elevation` prop alongside NativeWind shadows
- **Performance**: Build-time utility compilation via NativeWind v4

### Future Benefits
- **Dark Mode Ready**: Foundation established for `dark:` variant implementation
- **Maintainability**: Centralized design tokens in `tailwind.config.js`
- **Consistency**: Unified visual language across all screens

### Documentation Updated
- README.md: Enhanced tech stack section with design philosophy
- specs/DESIGN.md: Added Section 6 documenting UI architecture
- specs/tech-stack.md: Updated styling architecture details
